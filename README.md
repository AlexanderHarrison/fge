# FGE - Fast Graphing Engine

FGE is a graphing engine, like Geogebra or Desmos, built for speed.
Both Geogebra and Desmos are great for simple equations, but when evaluating
complicated expressions, and visualizing changes over time
they can be annoyingly slow. FGE uses JIT compilation and geometry shaders 
to display all but the most monstrous of equations in real-time.

# Limitations
FGE is very much a work in progress.

TODO:
- Multiple equations at a time.
- Support integration, differentiation, mathematical functions.
- UI for inputting expressions.
- Independent x and y scaling.
- Fix visual bugs.
